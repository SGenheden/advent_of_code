# Advent of code

This is my solutions to the Advent of code challenges.

Install requirements with 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Most of the script can be run with e.g.

```
python solutions2017/day1/part1.py < input.txt
```

Unit test written with `pytest` in mind

```
pytest tests/
```
